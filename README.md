# MNN-Classifier
This Multilayer Neural Network Classifier is used to classify the SUN image dataset of Princeton University as a part of our project of the "Machine Vision" Course at Ain-Shams University (ASU)
## ðŸ“Œ Objective
This project explores various techniques used in image classification. The goal is to implement multiple classifiers to categorize RGB images and compare their performance to determine the most effective approach.

## ðŸ“– Description
Image classification is a core challenge in computer vision. Traditionally, it involves a two-stage process:
1. **Feature Extraction** â€“ Extract meaningful features from images.
2. **Classification** â€“ Use machine learning algorithms to classify images based on extracted features.

Two main approaches are explored:
- **Traditional Method**: Uses HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) features with classifiers like KNN, K-means, and SVM.
- **Deep Learning Method**: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for end-to-end feature extraction and classification.



## ðŸ§© Project Structure & Milestones

### Milestone 1: Traditional Classification
- **Feature Extraction**: Use OpenCV to extract HOG features.
- **Classifiers**:
  - **KNN**: Implemented from scratch.
  - **K-means**: Implemented from scratch.
  - **SVM**: Implemented using Scikit-learn.

### Milestone 2: CNN Classification
- **Custom CNN**: Build and train a CNN using TensorFlow.
- **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tune a pretrained TensorFlow model for the classification task.
